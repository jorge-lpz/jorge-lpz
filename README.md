## Projects

<details>
  <summary>IBM Device Management</summary>
  
  ### IBM Device Management
  I worked on a team of 6 in the creation of a device lending web application for internal IBM use. We utilized Angular and Carbon Design  for the frontend of the application and Expressjs for the backend. We used IBM's DB2 for our database and we deployed our project to Kubernetes in the IBM Cloud. I primarily worked on the frontend of the application as well as a lot of the documentation of the project.

  <summary>Traffic Simulator</summary>
  
  ### Traffic Simulator
  I worked on a team of 5 people to create a multi-agent system to model traffic at various intersections. We used Unity for the visualization and agentpy for the multi-agent simulation. The actual simulation would run in real time on the IBM cloud and the Unity visualization would request the position of all vehicles and traffic light colors from the cloud. I primarily worked on the visualization using Unity.

  ### BANX Android App
   worked on a team of 4 to develop a native android application for the Food Bank of Guadalajara. The app would allow users to donate money to the food bank as well as keep up to date with information about the food bank. We utilized Jetpack Compose to create the application and implemented Twitter and Google Maps integration using their respective apis. On this project I worked primarily on the creation of the various pages that were needed and the Google Maps integration.
